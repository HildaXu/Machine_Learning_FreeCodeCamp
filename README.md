# Machine_Learning_FreeCodeCamp

This repository contains all my notes and projects for [Machine Learning with Python from FreeCodeCamp][1].

## Course Summay

This free online course includes using TensorFlow framework to build several neural networks and explore more advanced techniques like natural language processing and reinforcement learning. It also dive into neural networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional neural networks work.
